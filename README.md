# Hi there!

I'm Mauricio Villavicencio, a Computer Science student and teaching assistant at the University of Minnesota with a passion for natural language processing and artificial intelligence. My skills lie in Java, C, but I have a particular liking to Python. I also find a great joy in helping others learn and succeed in their computer science journeys.
